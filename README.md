# Omnifood Website

<p>This project is the final project from the "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" course on Udemy. It is a landing page intended for a fictitious company called Omnifood.</p>

<p>Omnifood is a technology company with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Many people are very busy with their jobs, families, friends, and other important activities, which leaves little time for cooking. This lifestyle can lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. We aim to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans in selected cities. All this is available through a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.</p>

<p>While this project doesn't have all the AI capabilities, it serves as a landing page to showcase the concept.</p>
